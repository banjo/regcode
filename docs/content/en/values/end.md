The start value represents the end of a string. Meaning, the match needs to end at the end of the string you are trying to match.

If you use it without the `multiline` flag, it will end the match at the end of the string for only one line. If you use the `multiline` flag, it will do that on every line.

## Usage

`[end]`
## Regex

```
$
```

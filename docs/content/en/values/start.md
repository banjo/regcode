The start value represents the start of a string. Meaning, the match needs to begin at the beginning of the string you are trying to match.

If you use it without the `multiline` flag, it will start the match at the start of the string for only one line. If you use the `multiline` flag, it will do that on every line.

## Usage

`[start]`
## Regex

```
^
```
